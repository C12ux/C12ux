Welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹


I use this GitHub account to share projects that reflect my journey as a BSCS student. I'm passionate about networks and cybersecurity, and I enjoy working with Java. Lately, I've been exploring the low-level side of computing through assembly language and digital circuits. I also creae websites for fun!
